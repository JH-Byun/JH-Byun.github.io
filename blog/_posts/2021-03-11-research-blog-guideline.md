Since it's becoming really important to show my research efforts via internet space, many researchers begin to post their works on blogs.
However, for the researchers who haven't usually write posts about their daily life, the most difficult step is to start blogging.
For me also, it was really hard to make the blog platform and post some beginning articles. And until now, it is still hard to manage my blog.
Therefore, I search on google about "how to make a blog for the researchers", and I found a quite valuable post about this topic.

If you are interested in posting your research effort on the blog and still have a problem with posting the first article,
please follow the instructions shown in this article below.
