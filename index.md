## Profile
In Spring 2020, I joined <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR (Laboratory for Autonomous Robotics Research)</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **aerial robotics**. My research interests in robotics are in **aerial manipulation** [<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/T-ASE/">1</a>].  

I am currently working with <a href="https://dongjaelee95.github.io/" target="_blank">Dongjae Lee</a>, Dohyun Eom and <a href="https://github.com/JunhaAgu" target="_blank">Junha Kim</a>.

## Recent Updates

#### October 2024
I will orally present my RA-L work on "Image-Based Time-Varying Contact Force Control of Aerial Manipulator using Robust Impedance Filter" at IROS 2024 held in أَبُو ظَبِي (Abu Dhabi), UAE. 

#### June 2024
I orally presented my work on haptic-based bilateral teleoperation of an aerial manipulator for extracting a wedged object with the compensation of human reaction time at ICUAS 2024 held in Χανιά (Chania), Crete, Greece.

#### May 2024
I orally presented my T-ASE work on transient performance-enhancing hybrid control of an aerial manipulator extracting a wedged object [<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/T-ASE/">1</a>] at ICRA 2024 held in 横浜 (Yokohama), Japan.

## Purpose of Posting
As a graduate student, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our research team publish a paper to conferences or journals and our team's open projects on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">STUDY</a> tab. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab and <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab to share my personal life, too.

## Will it be helpful for you?
If you are interested in analyzing the aerial manipulation using the concept of hybrid dynamical systems, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, you can also contact me using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

In addition, I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
