## Profile
In Spring 2020, I joined <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **aerial robotics**. My research interests in robotics are in **aerial manipulation**[<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICCAS/">1</a>] and **hybrid dynamical system**.  

I am currently working with <a href="https://dongjaelee95.github.io/" target="_blank">Dongjae Lee</a>. 

## Purpose of Posting
As a graduate student, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">Publications</a> tab whenever our research team publish a paper to conferences or journals. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">Blog</a> tab and <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">Photography</a> tab to share my personal life, too.
