## Profile
In Spring 2020, I joined <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **aerial robotics**. My research interests in robotics are in **aerial manipulation** [<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICCAS/">1</a>] and **hybrid dynamical system**.  

I am currently working with <a href="https://dongjaelee95.github.io/" target="_blank">Dongjae Lee</a>. 

## Purpose of Posting
As a graduate student, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our research team publish a paper to conferences or journals. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab and <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab to share my personal life, too.

## Will it be helpful for you?
If you are interested in analyzing the aerial manipulation using the concept of hybrid dynamical systems, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, you can also contact me using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

In addition, I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
