In Spring 2017, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **Robotics**. I am currently working with <a href="http://yjh5455.wixsite.com/jaehyun/" target="_blank">Jaehyun Yoo</a>, <a href="http://sjlazza.com/" target="_blank">Seungjae Lee</a>, and Clark. Youngdong. Son.

[comment]: <> (I am very grateful for the many friends, advisors and my family which support me on this journey.)
[comment]: <> (### developing artificial 3D perception)

My research interests in robotics are in **Networked UAV control** and **Machine learning**.
