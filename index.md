In Spring 2020, I joined <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **aerial robotics**. I am currently working with <a href="https://dongjaelee95.github.io/" target="_blank">Dongjae Lee</a> and Inkyu Jang.

My research interests in robotics are in **aerial manipulation**[[1]] and **hybrid dynamical system**.
