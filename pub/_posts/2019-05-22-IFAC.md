In this paper, we propose a method to improve the networked UAV control system using event-triggered control and model predictive control (MPC). Although the UAV control over the network has many advantages, it involves a long-time delay and packet loss, which adversely affects real-time control performance. Delay compensation algorithms in the networked control system (NCS) have been proposed to address such issues, however, they do not consider the resource limit of the network and congestion may occur. Then the packet loss and network delay issues can even be worsened. In this study, we propose a method to reduce the generation of less important control signals and to use the network more efficiently by using event-triggered control. Since the event-triggered control method is also influenced by the network delay, an event trigger function suitable for NCS is designed. We validated the effectiveness of networked UAV control system and event-triggered control by simulation.
