## Description
1. General definition
* $S$ is covered by *a collection of open sets*, $O$: $S \subset $ (at least one member of) $O$
* $S$ is said to compact, if, for every covering $O$ of $S$ by open sets, $S$ is covered by some finite set of members of $O$
2. Euclidean space ($\R^{n}$)
* **closed** and **bounded** subset of Euclidean space
* E.g. closed interval, rectagnle, finite set of points
* Detail proof in [2].
