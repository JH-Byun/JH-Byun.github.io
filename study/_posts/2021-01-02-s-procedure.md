## Description
<br>
The S-procedure is also called "S-lemma". <br><br>
**Definition**: It is a mathematical process to find the equivalent *linear matrix inequality (LMI)* that makes a *particular quadratic inequality*. <br><br>
**Procedure (w/o proof)** <br>
*IF* <br>
$0 \leq z^TF_{0}z \, \rightarrow \, 0 \leq z^TF_{1}z$ <br>
and <br>
there exists $z_0 \, s.t. \, 0 \leq z_{0}^{T}F_{0}z_{0}$ <br>
*THEN* <br>
there exists a nonnegative $\tau \, s.t. \, \tau F_{1} \leq F_{0}$ <br>
