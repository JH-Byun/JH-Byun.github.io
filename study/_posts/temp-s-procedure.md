## Description
<br>
The **S-procedure** is also called "S-lemma". <br>
**Definition**: It is a mathematical process to find the equivalent **linear matrix inequality (LMI)** that makes a **particular quadratic inequality**. <br>
**Procedure (w/o proof)** <br>
**IF** <br>
1. $z^TF_{0}z \req 0 \rightarrow z^TF_{0}z \req 0$ <br>
2. $\exists z_0 s.t. z_{0}^{T}F_{0}z_{0} \req 0$ <br>
**THEN**  <br>
$\exists \tau \req 0 s.t. F_{0} \req \tau F_{1}$ holds <br>
