## Autonomous hybrid systems
Differential equation which describes the system changes with the continuous state and the discrete state (a.k.a. "mode"). For example, a robotic manipulator which can interact with various environments such as wall, operating surface, etc. has two modes, the free mode (end-effector not interacting with environment) and the contact mode (end-effector interacting with environment). 

## General theorems

## Example: Multi DOF robotic manipulator
