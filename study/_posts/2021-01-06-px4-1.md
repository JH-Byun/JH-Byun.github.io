## Description
* sample: name of the variable to be published. <br>
* Header values can be published if the time information is necessary. <br><br>
1. safety_area/set
* Send the limited area of flight.
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/PolygonStamped
* What we need to publish?: geometry_msgs/Point32[] sample.polygon.points
2. setpoint_accel/accel
* Send the desired acceleration (in position).
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/Vector3Stamped
* What we need to publish?: sample.vector.x, sample.vector.y, sample.vector.z
3. setpoint_attitude/cmd_vel
* Send the desired angular velocity 
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/TwistStamped
* What we need to publish?: sample.twist.angular.omegadot_x, sample.twist.angular.omegadot_y, sample.twist.angular.omegadot_z
4. setpoint_attitude/attitude
* Send the desired attitude setpoint (Quaternions)
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
* What we need to publish?: sample.pose.orientation.x, sample.pose.orientation.y, sample.pose.orientation.z, sample.pose.orientation.w
5. setpoint_attitude/thrust 
* Send the command full thrust input T (in [N])
* Data Type: mavros_msgs/Thrust
* What we need to publish?: sample.thrust
6. setpoint_position/local
* Send the desired position and yaw angle.
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
* What we need to publish?: sample.pose.position.x, sample.pose.position.y, sample.pose.position.z, sample.pose.orientation (The full desired quaternion value will be sended but only YAW information will be subscribed!) 
7. setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped
* Send the desired velocity but the time information is deleted. 
* Data Type: geometry_msgs/Twist
* What we need to publish?: sample.twist.linear.v_x, sample.twist.linear.v_y, sample.twist.linear.v_z
