title: "MATLAB simulation video of the plug-pulling task using an aerial manipulator"
use_math: true

To simulate the aerial manipulator which holds onto the plug attached to the socket, I made a corresponding MATLAB simulation. The below video is the result of my recent work about aerial manipulation and hybrid controller design.

Source code is uploaded on my private github repository but it will be soon transformed into pulic repository.
