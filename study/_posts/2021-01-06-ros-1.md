## Description
I found a useful website you can start with when you are interested in px4 SITL using ROS, gazebo. However, before that, you need to understand the basic structure of Robot Operating Systems. <br>
So, if you are new to ROS system, please look at the reference [1]. If not, take a look at reference [2] to follow instructions about px4 SITL. <br>
