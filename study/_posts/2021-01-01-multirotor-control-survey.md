1. Classical PID
- characteristics
<ul>
  - one of the most well-known control law <br>
  - based on the transfer function between the control input and Euler angles <br>
  - assuming that the multirotor is on the hovering state <br>
  </ul>
- advantages
<ul>
  - easy to implement
  </ul>
- disadvantages
<ul>
  - hard to track fast trajectories
  - need some modifications for the aggressive manoeuver
  </ul>
      
  + LQR controller
    - characteristics
      - 
    - advantages
      -
    - disadvantages
      - only offers an optimal solution when the multirotor is near hover state
