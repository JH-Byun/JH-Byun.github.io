## Description
1. Outline
* Part of an applied mathematics
* Result of the stability of differential equation's solution
2. Theorem summary <br>
**IF**: For the singular pertubation from of an autonomous system, <br>
**THEN**: the exact solutions of the differential equation $z(t,\epsilon)$, $x(t,\epsilon)$ are $\epsilon$-close to that of nominal dynamics $\bar{z}(t)$, $\bar{x}(t)$ and the solution of fast dynamics $z(t,\epsilon)$ converges to the nominal solution $\bar{z}(t)$.
