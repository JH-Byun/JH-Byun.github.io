title: "[MARKDOWN] How to write mathematical equations to the markdown files?"
---

I want to share useful websites about **"How to write mathematical equations to the markdown files?"** <br>
<br>
Please follow intructions below <br>
(English) <http://benlansdell.github.io/computing/mathjax/> <br>
(Korean) <https://junsk1016.github.io/markdown/%EC%88%98%EC%8B%9D-%EC%A0%81%EC%9A%A9%EC%8B%9C%EC%BC%9C%EC%84%9C-%ED%99%9C%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0/> <br>
<br>
**Cautions** <br>
* In the english version, change the file name "_mathjax_support.html"  into "mathjax_support.html" <br>
* In both versions, complete form of the mathematical equations would not appear on the .md file. These will appear at the website you made.
